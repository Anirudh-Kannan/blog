It is the way they represent the image that they call “Visual-Semantic Embedding”. They run an object detector for the images and represent each object by the penultimate layer of the object detection network. Then, they learn a projection of the object representations such that hidden states of the text encoder can be expressed as a linear combination of the projected object representations.\nCompared to the standard unsupervised translation that relies on iterative back-translation, this way of training improves the translation quality quite a lot. On the other hand, the standard unsupervised methods are designed to work with much larger datasets and these data come from a quite narrow domain. When they integrate this training machinery into a supervised learning setup in addition to standard training examples, they reach the state-of-the-art results.")]),e._v(" "),n("h2",{attrs:{id:"_1-background"}},[n("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#_1-background"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" 1.
